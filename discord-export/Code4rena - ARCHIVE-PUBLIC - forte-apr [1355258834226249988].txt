I would like to clarify this once.
This is technically not a protocol audit but a library audit.
Will the judges and validators have certain level of benchmark (no funds involved) for identifying meds / highs.
Afaik there can't be a high unless funds are involved and my assumption is any finding, even if it's a precision issue will be marked medium here.

a significant error in calculation results that can cause a major issue will be considered high! severties are based more on context of the protocol being audited i guess!

I'd also really appreciate clarification of rules here - it would be nice to know how big of an error constitutes a medium or high otherwise we're all just shooting in the dark.

Prioritize Arithmetic Operations. Start with `add`, `sub`, `mul`, and `div` as they underpin all higher-level logic.

Hi, someone could please explain to me clearly what cases in blockchain space or maybe defi space need big number like uint512 and float128?


[04/02/2025 12:41] riceee8969
Also, I wanna clarify something. if I am grasping it correctly, this isn’t exactly a float128 representation right? since the **packedFloat** type stores the value either in 145-bits or 256-bits depending on the mantissa size?


[04/02/2025 13:51] johnathan8759
Much of the defi space has been centered around simple mathematical formulas with low precision requirements. Much of this comes from the fact that there is no native fixed-point or floating-point types in Solidity. This library can serve as a building block for those doing more complex mathematical calculations.

[04/02/2025 15:59] johnathan8759
Can you clarify your question? Are you asking whether this follows the IEEE standard for quadruple float numbers?


[04/02/2025 16:37] riceee8969
Hello, its somewhat related to the IEEE format, but not exactly. What I was trying to understand is that, in the IEEE float128 representation, exactly 128 bits are used to represent a floating-point number. However, based on my understanding of this Float128 library, the representation works a bit differently.  

According to the **bitmap**, the `packedFloat` format appears to use either **129 or 240 bits** for the **mantissa**, along with **16 bits** for the **exponent, sign, and flag**. This would mean that the actual floating-point representation in this library is either **145 bits** (`129 + 16`) or **256 bits** (`240 + 16`).  

I just want to confirm, does this understanding sound correct?


[04/02/2025 17:50] gordon_39360
This information can be found in the float128.pdf as well as the bitmap in Types.sol


[04/02/2025 18:31] riceee8969
I see, thanks! Will take a closer look at those


[04/02/2025 22:10] illoy_sci
Hi there, 
If your tests are failing and says something along the lines of "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'eth_abi'\n", the C4 readme instructs us to create a virtual environment but the testing set up doesnt actually use it. To resolve this issue, go into test/FloatUtils.sol and modify
 inputs[0] = "python3" 
to actually use the virtual environment created, such as 
inputs[0] = "./venv/bin/python3"
may this be helpful :neuroBucket:

Hello, follow up on this. The bitmap in Types.sol say the M_MANTISSA uses 128 bits of space but the README file says the M_MANTISSA uses 129 bits of space, wanted to confirm which one should be considered correct. Thank you!

All things aside, I really *do* recommend a PoC
This helps signal so much and usually give more more insights into the code base when you are building it
My personal standard is if I can't make a PoC, then it's probably not a vulnerability. Unless it's something theoratical and can't be produced easily on local environments

[04/04/2025 18:08] oscar_01076
Hi EngPips, this Python code is "normalizing" at 75 digits (makes the mantissa of the bigger number to have 75 digits) trying to prevent an overflow if the result of the addition grows a digit more (77 digits if it had normalized to 76).  The overflow risk is valid for signed integers in Solidity, however the actual Solidity implementation uses 76 instead because we use unsigned integers for the arithmetic. The Python code snippets are trying to showcase the main philosophy of the algorithm used in Solidity, and the Solidity implementation was inspired by this work, but it is not a direct translation of it. I hope this answers your question, but if you have more doubts, please let us know


[04/04/2025 18:48] oscar_01076

@Johnathan @Oscar @Gordon I have a question regarding this part in doc: 
**Exponent / Mantissa Limitations**
Floating number representations with exponents greater than 3000 or less than -3000 are not within acceptable bounds for this library. Failure to abide by this limitation may result in precision loss and/or arithmetic overflows/underflows.

Additionally, the __maximum digits the library is meant to handle accurately are 72__. Any digits higher than that value are not expected to be secure and may result in precision loss, arithmetic overflows/underflows, or other unforeseen errors.

By the "maximum digits" you mean the Mantissa or the total digits? For example is 1e80 a valid input?


[04/11/2025 16:20] agent3bood
How important is pointing the 'root cause' of an issue? Also do we need to suggest solution?
I am not a math machine so this is hard for me


[04/11/2025 16:39] oscar_01076
@MaxZuvex the mantissa of the number that is going to be converted to a packedFloat can have only up until 72 digits if high precision is expected. 1e80 has 81 digits. You could represent the same number by 1e71 with exponent 9

[04/14/2025 01:03] glightspeed
if your report contains enough details and PoC, it will be most likely to be judged as high as well


[04/14/2025 01:38] glightspeed
I read very clever findings indeed. Someone crossed the line!


[04/14/2025 05:40] mysteryauditor
I think the severity of issue which missing validation for the check of the sign for input of ln() function is indeed QA/low.


[04/14/2025 05:40] mysteryauditor
Since anyone doesn't try to calculate ln() of negative number.


[04/14/2025 05:57] glightspeed
Normal people won't do. Attacker does


[04/14/2025 05:59] glightspeed
I don't think it's allowed to discuss findings in public chats


[04/14/2025 15:53] v_2110
What are the approximate time estimates for triage, sponsor review and judging?

Our audit timeline [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/other-details/our-process) may help 🙂

I just checked the dashboard so out of all high submissions only a few have been triaged so it will take time or what to triage all findings?? I know it is a noob question


[04/15/2025 13:06] thebrittfactor
Correct, it takes a bit for triage. The validator is close to wrapping up and the low signal issues will be processed once their review is completed.


[04/15/2025 13:08] _arnavjindal
Thanks for the response. This is like my first serious audit just anxious about the review

What does "triage" mean? (My question is even more noob hahaa :D)


[04/16/2025 12:56] maxzuvex
What would happen if someone submitted a superset of two issues? for example for one of the function that produce wrong results for x<=0, some people submitted two separate issues for x<0 and x=0.


[04/17/2025 07:17] illoy_sci
I believe the superset issue would be treated as the primary issue, as there are already comments like this in the current dashboard iirc. Then the separate issues can be treated as duplicated/partial duplicated

{Reactions}

[04/17/2025 07:31] illoy_sci
Hmmms... I noticed that a comment was left by the validator after one of my issue was triaged as invalid... After looking at the comment, I carefully rechecked the readMe, and then rechecked the Poc, and then rechecked the function behaviour locally. I am *pretty* confidant that the comment presents a misunderstanding and contradicts both:
- The readme.md specification, and
- Actual function behaviour
I understand that this is a math library that's out of ordinary for most contests, and that validators only have 48 hours or so to quickly scan through and put up the reports triage status, let alone with all the work of grouping duplication etc.. I also understand that validator's comment is only advisory and judge needs to make the final decision. However, if it is a misunderstanding from the validator on how certain functionalities are suppose to work, it may affect many other reports... for sponsor review etc.. Is there a way to contact/communicate with the validator in any way?
I'm not asking for like a retriage or complain something, just would like to discuss or have a bit more clarification.

[04/17/2025 08:59] chainsentry
@thebrittfactor | C4 if i feel my finding was disputed wrongly, when do i get a chance to fight it?

f-29 for example, their reasoning is the issue is valid but it happens in other math systems too. but the main issue i submitted was that it fails silently without throwing any errors which the “other math system” they mentioned all do the opposite


[04/17/2025 13:08] thebrittfactor
After initial judging is completed, PJ QA is opened for wardens to raise any concerns before judge decisions are finalized. However, [only SR wardens are able to participate in PJ QA](https://docs.code4rena.com/competitions/judging-criteria#post-judging-qa-pjqa). Please review the requirements [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/roles/sr-wardens) to see if you qualify!

@thebrittfactor | C4 Can you clarify this please?


[04/17/2025 16:30] codexbugmenot
Hey @thebrittfactor | C4 ,
The PJQA is exclusively for SR role wardens, and an issue was commented by judge that it is out of bounds, so known(-3k,3k and 72 digits), but the issue even persists within bounds so unknown , is there any way a non SR role warden can mention this i.e through private thread or something ?


[04/17/2025 16:52] cloudellie
I don't believe the judge has even started their review yet. And no - the docs are very clear on this: https://docs.code4rena.com/competitions/submission-guidelines#good-citizenship-is-a-requirement-for-compensation.

👍 

[04/17/2025 17:15] poliakovivan0707
That's right. According to doc, I think the missing validation  issue "x < = 0 for ln" can be only low severity:
```
Findings that require the user to be careless or enter the wrong information into a contract call are QA or Invalid.
```

I think that this only applies to user-facing inputs, i.e. sending ETH to some random address makes them locked. Here it’s a library so there could be some intermediary calculations that would lead to non-trivial bugs where the developer expected the library to revert. My 2 cents.
